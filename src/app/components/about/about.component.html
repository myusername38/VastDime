  </div>
  <p class="mlr-auto mt-xs mb-xs" style="max-width: 50%;">VastDime was created by Martin Smolka and Arnav Goswami in an attempt to provide an easy to use experience for individuals and collaborators to upload and share neat functions and snippets of code.</p>
  <p class="mlr-auto mt-xs mb-xs" style="max-width: 50%;">VastDime allows for an easy way to save, load, and share any code published online, along with privacy options, allowing users to keep sensitive code private.</p>
  <p class="mlr-auto mt-xs mb-xs" style="max-width: 50%;">Martin and Arnav are both Computer Science students at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and wanted a location to store their code that is not as professional or high profile as GitHub, and thus, VastDime was born.</p>
